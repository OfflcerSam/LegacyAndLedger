et_resolver,SHIP,"Developed by Eirin-Sahl Dynamics, the ESD–DC9 Resolver is a recent entry in the UTFE’s expanding doctrine of multirole independence. Officially designated a Destroyer–Carrier hybrid, the Resolver balances moderate firepower with high logistical utility and strikecraft projection, offering four fighter wings in a compact, support-focused frame.

Like most ESD vessels, the Resolver is a masterclass in spatial optimization—trading raw damage for adaptability. Field commanders rely on it for the sheer number of roles it might fill. Among fleet crews, it's affectionately known as the Toolbox; the ship you send when something needs doing, fixed, or found.

“Look, when you're pitching to charter fleets, stop trying to defend the firepower. They already know it's Eirin-Sahl. They know we pack these things like survival crates—no one's doubting the specs. What they actually want to know is: how does it feel to run?

It’s not just a destroyer, it’s not just a carrier—it’s a platform. The Toolbox can hold whatever their contract needs. It can host, refit, scan, and still have a payload ready if things turn hot. It's stable, modular, and it keeps working long after the fight’s over. That’s the angle. Sell them the uptime. Sell them the flexibility. And don’t forget—it’s got one of the better crew experiences we offer.”

et_contractor,SHIP,"Developed by Eirin-Sahl Dynamics, the ESD–EF48 Contractor II, affectionately nicknamed Deadline, is the backbone escort frigate of the EFF (Eterra Federated Fleet). Engineered with Eirin-Sahl’s hallmark spatial optimization, the Contractor II packs an outsized arsenal and multirole capability into a dense, modular frame—serving equally well in scout, pursuit, and escort roles.

Its signature design philosophy—function over comfort—has earned it a reputation as both indispensable and borderline inhumane among long-term crews. The Deadline earns its name through relentless deployment cycles and a tendency to be first on-scene and last to dock. The EF48 fills the gap, holds the line, and stays on schedule.

“Every time I open one up, I find something else that shouldn't fit—and somehow still does. It's a miracle of design and a nightmare to maintain. Beautiful, terrible work.”

sr_arrowhead,SHIP,"Pattern 245, Automated Frigate. Developed by Sampstonial Technologies originally a couple hundred years ago, the design has been iterated upon by advanced design algorithms and AI tweaking turning it from a bulky frigate to a sleeker automated frigate.

The AI designers gutted all human required bits but kept some interfacing ability, allowing for it's compact yet armored design.",,,
sr_beetle,SHIP,"Pattern 341, Command Frigate. Developed by Sampstonial Technologies within the last hundred years, the design has been slightly iterated upon by advanced design algorithms and AI tweaking turning it from a heavy and slow command destroyer, to a sleek semi-automated frigate. 

The AI of course kept the human required bits to allow for human interfacing to nearby automated ships and decent self-defense capabilities. Or if you want, just a nice smooth ride, this can also be modified more thanks to it's modularity to be more luxurious.",,,

UTFE,FACTION,"The United Trade Federation of Eterra (UTFE) is a recently formalized federal bloc, formed through a mix of military unification and structured diplomacy following years of fragmented trade control. Originally composed of independent trade powers and merchant factions, the member states of the UTFE were brought under a single framework after a brief but decisive conflict, largely insulated from outside interference due to their region’s natural isolation. Rather than dissolving its constituent powers, the UTFE layered a federal structure atop them—prioritizing economic continuity, interoperability, and regulatory cohesion. Trade remains the central pillar, enforced and protected by the Eterra Federated Fleet (EFF), a standardized military force composed of formally commissioned Fleet Assets alongside regulated charter forces.",,,
